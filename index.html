        Hi! How are you going? My name is Samuel and it's a pleasure to have you here on this site.
this site was created with the intention of helping my friend Kebba who lives in the Gambia, located in Africa, he and the inhabitants of his village fight against hunger every day, what we came here to ask for is your help so that they can see the hope of waking up alive the next day,He has been helping his siblings and children since last year through the internet, but he still needs more help.

        This is a picture of Kebba and the children in his village, this boy has been fighting not only for the children but for his mother and friends as well, but he still needs our help as he is unable to provide for his entire village and family, so I come to ask you to help him! I alone can't help him, but I ask for your help, any amount will already help them a lot and bring a little rest to their souls, if you have any doubts, or think it's a lie, you can access his instagram that I will leave it below, but please, think about the appeal I make to you, help these lives
